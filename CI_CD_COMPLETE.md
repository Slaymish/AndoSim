---

## How to Create Your First Release

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Update version
echo "1.0.0" > VERSION

# 2. Update CHANGELOG.md (replace date in [1.0.0] section)

# 3. Commit everything
git add .
git commit -m "Setup CI/CD for multi-platform builds"

# 4. Create and push tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0: Phase 4 Core + CI/CD"
git push origin main
git push origin v1.0.0

# 5. Watch the magic! üé©‚ú®
# Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/BlenderSim/actions
```

### What Happens Next

1. **GitHub Actions triggers** (automatic)
2. **Builds start in parallel** (~15-20 minutes):
   - Linux: Ubuntu + Eigen from apt
   - macOS: Homebrew dependencies
   - Windows: Chocolatey + manual Eigen download
3. **Tests run** on all platforms
4. **Release created** on GitHub with 3 ZIP files:
   - `ando_barrier_v1.0.0_linux_x64.zip`
   - `ando_barrier_v1.0.0_macos_universal.zip`
   - `ando_barrier_v1.0.0_windows_x64.zip`
5. **Users download** and install in Blender!

---

## Installation for Users

After release, users on any platform can:

1. Go to GitHub Releases page
2. Download ZIP for their OS
3. In Blender: Edit ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Add-ons ‚Üí Install
4. Select the ZIP file
5. Enable "Ando Barrier Physics"

**No compilation required!** Pre-built binaries for all platforms.

---

## What Each File Does

### `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- **Continuous Integration**: Runs on every push/PR
- **Matrix Build**: Tests all platforms simultaneously
- **Fast Feedback**: Know immediately if changes break any platform
- **Artifacts**: Stores builds for 90 days

### `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- **Release Automation**: Triggered by version tags
- **Multi-Platform**: Builds Linux, macOS, Windows in parallel
- **Asset Upload**: Attaches ZIPs to GitHub Release
- **User-Ready**: Creates installable packages

### `CMakeLists.txt` (updated)
- **Windows Support**: Detects Eigen from environment variable
- **MSVC Flags**: Optimized for Visual Studio compiler
- **Fallback Logic**: Tries multiple Eigen locations
- **Cross-Platform**: Same build script works everywhere

---

## CI/CD Features

### Automatic Testing
- ‚úÖ Unit tests run on every platform
- ‚úÖ Adaptive timestep tests (6 suites)
- ‚úÖ Heatmap color tests (3 suites)
- ‚úÖ Platform-specific validation

### Build Matrix
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
    python-version: ['3.11']
```
**Result**: 3 parallel builds, faster CI

### Dependency Management
- **Linux**: `apt-get` (libeigen3-dev, python3-dev)
- **macOS**: `brew` (eigen, pybind11)
- **Windows**: `choco` + manual Eigen download (3.4.0)

### Artifacts
- **Build Artifacts**: 90-day retention on GitHub
- **Release Assets**: Permanent (attached to release)
- **Size**: ~600 KB per platform

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required to test CI/CD)

```bash
# Stage all new files
git add .github/ CHANGELOG.md CI_CD_GUIDE.md VERSION CMakeLists.txt

# Commit
git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline for multi-platform builds

- GitHub Actions workflows for build and release
- Enhanced CMakeLists.txt for Windows/macOS
- Comprehensive CI/CD documentation
- Version tracking with CHANGELOG
"

# Push to main (triggers build.yml)
git push origin main

# Watch build: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/BlenderSim/actions
```

### First Release (When ready)

```bash
# Create version tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0: Phase 4 Core Features + CI/CD"

# Push tag (triggers release.yml)
git push origin v1.0.0

# Monitor: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/BlenderSim/actions
# Wait ~20 minutes for all platforms to build
# Check: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/BlenderSim/releases
```

### Testing the Workflow

Before creating v1.0.0, test with a pre-release:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0-rc.1 -m "Release Candidate 1"
git push origin v1.0.0-rc.1

# This will trigger release.yml but mark as pre-release
# Download artifacts and test on each platform
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Windows

**Check**:
1. Eigen download successful? (Look for "Download Eigen" step)
2. `EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR` set correctly? (Should be `C:\eigen-3.4.0`)
3. CMake found Eigen? (Look for "Using Eigen from..." message)

**Fix**:
- Verify URL in workflow: `https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/archive/3.4.0/eigen-3.4.0.zip`
- Update `CMakeLists.txt` fallback path if needed

### Build Fails on macOS

**Check**:
1. Homebrew updated? (`brew update`)
2. Eigen installed? (`brew list eigen`)
3. Universal binary? (Should support Intel + Apple Silicon)

**Fix**:
- Update `build.yml` to use `brew install --force eigen`

### Tests Fail

**Check**:
1. Which tests? (Look at test output in Actions log)
2. Platform-specific? (Compare Linux vs macOS vs Windows)
3. Floating point precision? (Windows may differ)

**Fix**:
- Add platform-specific test tolerances if needed
- Skip known issues with `@pytest.mark.skipif()`
