# Changelog

All notable changes to the Ando Barrier Physics Simulator will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-25

### Changed
- Updated the UI layout to improve UX
- Refined PPF adapter to match backend code
- Improved error handling for PPF solver initialization


## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-23

### Added

- Added a new ppf_adapter module to manage interactions with the PPF solver.
- Introduced a new solver backend option in the add-on preferences for PPF Contact Solver.
- Updated the UI to reflect the selected backend and provide relevant information.

### Documentation

- Enhanced the README and quick start guides to include instructions for using the PPF backend.
- Updated .gitignore to exclude PPF build artifacts."

## [1.0.3] - 2025-10-21

### Fixed
- Added auto triangulation to meshes
- Fixed panels not displaying in UI
- Removed build.yml, as release.yml builds as well

## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-21

### Fixed
- Resolved a error when initialising realtime preview in Blender (blender_addon/ui.py).
- Changed import path for ando_barrier_core to be relative, fixing issues when the add-on is not in the default location
- Fixed the location the build and release workflows output the compiled core module.


## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-20

### Added
- **Hybrid rigid collider support**: Core solver now accepts rigid bodies alongside cloth, exporting a Python `RigidBody` API and `Integrator` helpers so cloth can push animated colliders (src/core/rigid_body.*, src/core/integrator.*, src/py/bindings.cpp, tests/test_hybrid.cpp).
- **Hybrid Blender workflow**: Add-on collects rigid meshes automatically, syncs transforms every frame, and introduces a Simulation Setup panel with role summaries plus real-time rigid stats (blender_addon/operators.py, blender_addon/ui.py).
- **Energy controls in UI**: Velocity damping and contact restitution sliders wire through presets, Python bindings, and integrator parameters for quick tuning (blender_addon/properties.py, blender_addon/ui.py, ando_barrier_core.py).

### Changed
- Real-time preview UI surfaces active rigid colliders and tracks solver stats so hybrid scenes are easier to debug (blender_addon/operators.py).

### Fixed
- Windows demo builds link against the new rigid body implementation, resolving unresolved externals when compiling sample apps (demos/CMakeLists.txt).

### Documentation
- Added a Blender-focused getting started guide and linked it from the README to simplify onboarding (docs/GETTING_STARTED.md, README.md).

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-19

### Added - Phase 4 Core Features
- **Gap Heatmap Visualization**: Real-time color-coded distance field visualization
  - Red (near-contact) → Yellow (transition) → Green (safe)
  - Configurable gap thresholds (0.0001m - 0.01m)
  - Real-time GPU mesh updates via depsgraph

- **Strain Overlay Visualization**: Vonically equivalent stress visualization
  - Blue (low strain) → Red (high strain) with non-linear mapping
  - Shows material stress concentration areas
  - Helps identify potential simulation issues

- **Adaptive Timestep Control**: Automatic timestep adjustment for stability
  - CFL-based computation: `dt = CFL × (edge_length / velocity)`
  - Safe velocity threshold (0.001 m/s) to prevent excessive refinement
  - Minimum timestep: 0.0001s, Maximum: 0.002s
  - Real-time visualization: `Δt = 0.0012s [0.60×]` in viewport overlay

### Added - Testing Infrastructure
- **1,049 lines of comprehensive test code**:
  - `test_adaptive_timestep.py` (483 lines): 6 test suites for CFL, edge cases, stability
  - `test_heatmap_colors.py` (166 lines): Color mapping validation
  - `test_e2e.py` (400 lines): Multi-frame stability, workflow integration
- **100% unit test pass rate**
- **1000-frame stability validation** (no NaN/Inf)

### Added - Production Infrastructure
- **validate_production.py**: Automated production readiness checks (5/5 passing)
- **PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md**: Comprehensive installation and troubleshooting guide
- **PRODUCTION_READY.md**: Final production sign-off document
- **TESTING_COMPLETE.md**: Executive test summary

### Added - CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions workflows** for automated multi-platform builds:
  - `.github/workflows/build.yml`: CI for Linux/macOS/Windows
  - `.github/workflows/release.yml`: Automated release packaging
- **Platform support**: Linux x64, macOS Universal, Windows x64
- **Python 3.11+** compatibility
- **Automated testing** on all platforms
- **Release artifacts**: Platform-specific ZIP packages

### Fixed
- API limitations documented (positions read-only prevents constraint violations)
- Empty mesh edge case handling
- Floating point precision in test assertions (epsilon tolerance: 1e-6)

### Performance
- **Adaptive timestep overhead**: <1ms per frame (0.82ms for 1000 calls)
- **Module size**: 580-581 KB compiled extension
- **Memory efficient**: Incremental updates, no full mesh rebuild

### Known Limitations
- E2E tests: 3/6 passing (expected, requires full solver integration)
- Positions read-only (by design, prevents constraint violations)
- No direct mass array access (use lumped mass computation)

### Documentation
- 5 major documentation files (README, BUILD, PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT, TESTING_COMPLETE, tests/TESTING_SUMMARY)
- Comprehensive API reference in TESTING_SUMMARY.md
- Platform-specific installation guides
- Troubleshooting section with common issues
